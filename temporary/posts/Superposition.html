                        In this article, we deal with one of the most fundamental quantum properties, superposition, uncertainty, and localization, and that too without the introduction of cats (sorry Schrödinger!) or dogs. Though this article requires the reader to know some basic facts regarding the quantum world beforehand (the most extensive one being wave-particle duality), the overall gist of this article should not be much hard to grasp and understand once the reader has drawn upon the basic facts and digested the fact that wave-particle duality is a fundamental property of nature.

                        First, let’s just see what superposition is. Superposition is defined on Wikipedia as:
                     </p>
                     <p name="bef6" id="bef6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                        <i>the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states at the same time until is measured,</i>
                     </p>
                     <p name="3ee2" id="3ee2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                        Makes sense? No? Then, let’s boil it down to a handful of words rather than seeing the technical words. This definition covers the following aspects of superposition-
                        <ol>
                            <li>The system needs to be a Quantum Mechanical one. This just means that the system needs to be of a size of the order less than 10^-9 m. At the bigger scales, though these properties do exist, yet their applications are too small to be witnessed by the naked eye, or even through the instruments (more on this later).</li>
                            <li>The system exists in multiple states at the same time. This covers the main aspect of superposition and tells us that the considered quantum state inhibits two differing properties at the same time. The properties may be in the form of the position of the particles, or their momentum, or (in the case of quantum bits, or qubits) their bit value.</li>
                            <li>This behavior is followed until a measurement is undertaken. This covers yet another aspect of superposition, that, quantum superposition is acting on a particle/wave, only as long as it is not measured (to be covered in a future article).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        In this lecture, we would rigorously base our intuition on this definition and would follow it as a basis.
                     </p>

                        Now, we come onto the real prospect of this article- intuition. So, let’s define a two-dimensional grid (see figure) on which we’d base our knowledge of waves and particles. Let’s also add markings of some small arbitrary units onto this grid (considering the relative size of the unit is equivalent to the quantum scale). Let’s now add a quantum object onto this grid. Now, wave-particle duality necessitates that we highlight both - the wave, as well as, the particle aspect of the object.
                     </p>

                         <figcaption class="imageCaption">A quantum object as described on the cartesian plane. Note that the wave and the particle are not two different objects. Instead, they are two different interpretations of the same quantum object. Also, the wave drawn is not to scale and is quite an arbitrary one, which should not be looked into from the mathematical point of view, but just for the sake of understanding (diagram made using <a href="https://github.com/3b1b/manim">Manim)</a>.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                        Let me ask you a question now, where <i>exactly</i> is the particle? And as if immediately, you might answer, at (around) (-2.5, 1), and you’d be right! <i>But</i>, at the same time, let me ask you where <i>exactly</i> is the wave? And you would answer… wait, turns out, you can’t answer! And that’s all right. You can’t accurately tell where is the wave located, can you?
                    </p>
                    <p name="3ee2" id="3ee2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                        One thing you might consider is increasing the scale of the units on which we have defined the graph. Such that, on zooming out <i>very very</i> much, the wave seems to be a point. But again, when you zoom out a bit, you lose at least some information about accuracy (just like- looking on the natural number scale with a one 1cm gap in between two natural numbers, you lose the information about where <i>exactly</i> √2 or 1.01001000100001 is present). And also, there is even a limit to how much you can zoom out, as if you zoom out too much, you’d no longer be in a quantum world! So, in a nutshell, you <i>can</i> talk about the not-so-exact position of the wave by zooming out.
                    </p>
                    <p name="3ee2" id="3ee2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                        Now, the wave and the particle, are they different quantum objects? No, they are not. They are just two different representations of the <i>same</i> object. So, in one representation of the object, we have a specific position, but in the other, we don’t. So, which one is correct? Turns out both are equally correct, and this is what Quantum Mechanics is all about. <i>Superposition is all about a particle showing the property of a wave.</i> Because the wave nature, of the particle, cannot have an exact position, the particle has to follow this, it cannot have an exact position. And this <i>exactly</i> (no ambiguity whatsoever) what we mean by ‘existing in multiple states/positions at once’, a concept which people know by the name of ‘superposition’.
                    </p>
                    <p name="3ee2" id="3ee2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                        But, if you look at the figure for a while, you seem to get the picture. You can’t define the <i>exact</i> position of the wave, but at least, you can tell where it is likely to be found. I mean, of course, you can say with great accuracy, that the wave is not present at (0, 3) and that the wave should be present at (0, 0). And this, again, is right! This is what is termed as ‘localization’ in the world of physics. You saw the area, in which the wave is present!
                    </p>
                    <p name="3ee2" id="3ee2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                        Merging this quintessential result, with our earlier conclusion, we come to the opinion that though the object can be in multiple states at once, yet, there is more chance that we would find the object at a particular locus (represented here by the region of the presence of the wave) than at some other (the region where the wave is not present). And so, a probability of finding the object comes into the picture. This is known as ‘uncertainty of position’ of the particle.
                    </p>

                    <hr>

                    <p name="3ee2" id="3ee2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                        Another aspect that comes straight out of this wave-particle duality is the ‘uncertainty of momentum’.
                    </p>
                    <p name="3ee2" id="3ee2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                        To understanding, let’s again go back to our favorite grid system. Let’s focus on the wave now and ask some questions. What is the frequency of the wave? And again, that should be quite an easy question to answer if you project the wave against a time axis. But, can you find the frequency of the particle when in a similar case? And you could say, of course, we could plot the motion of the particle in time and we could find out the frequency then, but wait! Here we’ll be finding the frequency of the motion of the particle and not of the particle (Note that we find the frequency of the wave). In case you follow this hack, then also, you would note that when we plot the graph of the motion of the particle and therefore find the frequency, we are considering the frequency of the path of the <i>motion</i> traced by the particle as a whole, defining the position of which is similar to the ‘uncertainty of position’ case!
                    </p>
                    <p name="3ee2" id="3ee2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                        You might ask, what is the relation of frequency which momentum, and it is true for everything but quantum objects, as for quantum objects, momentum is found by the formula, p = h/λ, where h is the Planck’s constant and λ is the wavelength, which can also be written as p = fh/v, where f = frequency and v = velocity, considering that λ = v/f. Thus, uncertainty in momentum is equivalent to what we proved before.
                    </p>
                    <p name="3ee2" id="3ee2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                        Therefore, the uncertainty in momentum and uncertainty position are related as we saw in this section. This is what entails the principle of ‘Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle’, a foundational base of modern Quantum Mechanics.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <hr>
                    <br>
                    <p name="3ee2" id="3ee2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                        In a nutshell, this is what entails the concept of superposition and uncertainty as a whole. Why people consider this hard to digest is because they consider either of the representation of a quantum object- either the wave aspect, or the particle aspect. The key to understanding is to entail each of them as an integral part of the quantum object, without which neither is complete without the other.
                    </p>
                    <p name="3ee2" id="3ee2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
                        The physical part of ‘uncertainty’ is what is entailed here. This is a direct consequence of the mathematics of uncertainty, which leads to the famous inequation: Δx·Δp ≥ h/4π, where Δ stands for the uncertainties. It is important to note that the effects of these quantum and “unintuitive” effects are equally in effect as you read this article or take a stroll in a park. But the reason why we don’t see people eating pies and waffles at the same time or cats both dead and alive is because of the very, very, very small wave-like properties of classical objects; and this is what prevents you from ‘Strolling the Quantum Lane’ and strolling a Boston Lane at the same time!
