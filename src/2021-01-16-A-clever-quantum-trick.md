# Spin and Discreteness

Perhaps the most confusing topic which beginners get stuck on, is spin. What one understands by spin obviously depends upon his/her size of reference and of course, his/her intuition! Considering the first fact, the word ‘spin’ generates a wildfire of ideas in the mind of a beginner. What a person would imagine at first when he hears about the word ‘spin’ would of course be none other than a top spinning about its axis, or, the Earth spinning about its axis, going about its ‘day’ly business! But contrary to the popular image, students are taught in high-school, quantum mechanical spin is not about rotational mechanics, as in classical systems, or is it?

We’ll come to this later. First, let’s just see, what ‘spin’ really means in quantum mechanical systems. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)),

> **Spin** is an intrinsic form of angular momentum carried by elementary particles, composite particles (hadrons), and atomic nuclei.

So, what does this mean? The answer to this question would be better answered by seeing *why* spin was assigned to the electrons in the first place? The story dates back to the early 1900s. Physicists observed that in Quantum systems, *something* was missing. So, what do we mean by something?

1. When the observed atomic spectra (the wavelengths of radiations absorbed the electrons of an atom) of multi-electronic species were compared to what people *thought* should have been their atomic spectra, there were small deviations. Though these were small, yet they reflected a thing; that our atomic models were not yet completely accurate.

2. According to classical electrodynamics, any charged particle on accelerating would produce a magnetic field around it; we know that electrons are charged particles. Physicists were shocked by the result of an experiment where it was found that electrons themselves act like tiny magnets.

3. When the angular momentum of atomic interactions was witnessed by physicists, they found that the law of conservation of angular momentum was not conserved! Considering physicists at the time believed it to be a fundamental law of nature, they argued that it can’t be broken in quantum systems.

What came out from these results was the fine idea of quantum spin. The (conservationists) physicists declared that the law was NOT broken, instead, the disagreements were coming because the electron itself possessed an *intrinsic* angular momentum all the time, which means that the electron itself is possessing an angular momentum, sort of, *inside* it, which is adding up to give this disparity in the conservation of angular momentum. Now, **this does NOT mean that the electron is spinning**. This angular momentum is an inherent property of spin, and we can’t question it. We need to digest this fact, just like we digest the fact that electrons possess mass, or electrons possess charge!

The experiment mentioned in the second point is what is known as the [Stern-Gerlach Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment). The deflection in the path of the electrons during this experiment measures the intrinsic angular momenta of the electrons. The experiment showed that the spin/intrinsic angular momentum is ‘quantized’, that is it can remain in multiples of a particular number when measured. It can not be **anywhere** in between. In other words, it is ‘discrete’! And, because of the wide consensus on classical electrodynamics among physicists during the beginning of the 20th century, it was hypothesized that electrons would also be ‘spinning’ due to the reasons mentioned before, a concept which has now been withdrawn, and that’s where the name ‘spin’ came into existence (and still sticks).

Note that in 5 (without prior measurement), the electrons are present in ONLY two places, they are not and can not be in between the two spots. This proves that spin is a quantized quantum number.</figcaption>

Revisiting the bolded part in the previous section, it should be noted that you are not the only one who has trouble digesting this fact. You are in the company of Werner Heisenberg and Paul Dirac (*see Ralph Kronig*)! In fact, that’s where physicists thought that perhaps, it would be better to define spin as a **spatial orientation** of the particle.

We’ll revisit this later, but first, how did the introduction of spin affect the atomic spectra? Well, if you relate spin to classical angular momenta, then you would probably come to the opinion this viewpoint necessitates that we associate a sort of energy with the electron. Why? Because if there's an angular momentum to it, then there’s an associated Torque (because $ \tau = \frac{\overline{dL}}{dt}$, don’t worry if you are unfamiliar with these symbols). Now, if there’s torque, some work is done, and if work is then, then that means the system possessed … energy (as energy is just the ability to do work)! This was experimentally proved with the case of an accurate description of Hydrogen spectral lines. These two results, hydrogen spectral line observation, and the Stern-Gerlach experiment explained (and proved) spin to be ‘*an intrinsic form of angular momentum carried by elementary particles*’.

## Spin and Spatial Orientation
Jumping on to the promised stuff, how can angular momentum affect the spatial orientation of the particle? Well, with a godly amount of math (group theory and representation theory), you can prove that the intrinsic angular momentum of a particle affects its spatial orientation. Why? Well, I like to think of it in this way. After all, if something is termed as angular momentum, it *would* create a turning effect in the object, right? There’s just one twist, that this momentum is intrinsic instead of extrinsic! So, if an extrinsic angular momentum can change the rotational mechanics of an object, then its intrinsic angular momentum will change … the spatial orientation.

A result that follows from this spin-spatial orientation correlation is the explanation of a ‘$\frac{1}{2}$’ spin of an electron. A question that might arise would be, “What does it mean for the spin to be ‘$\frac{1}{2}$?’,” To understand, let’s define, a beginning arbitrary configuration of an electron, and let’s start rotating it say, in a particular direction. So, this ‘$\frac{1}{2}$’ spin means that the electron will be completely symmetric/identical to its original configuration on $\frac{1}{1/2} \times 360° = 2 \times 360° = 720°$. A follow-up question may go like, “What do you mean by a ‘$720°$ turn, isn’t it the same as a $360°$ turn,” and like all other questions the answer would be in affirmative to this question, partially. Because- 1. A $360° = 720°$, for a 2D figure. When we talk about this analogy, we are often picturing a circle in our minds. In fact, this is the reason, why two angles are preferred over one angle (or a solid angle) when we have to talk about 3D geometries, for eg, in astrophysics and quantum computational sciences (Bloch Sphere!). 2. Electrons are not exactly ‘circular’ or ‘elliptical’ in shape. They are considered to be point-objects, and often it is arbitrary to talk about the shape of an electron, owing to wave-particle duality.

(For the more advanced and mathematically-oriented reader, this is because the rotation operator for a quantum state can be represented as $e^{(-i)(s)(\theta)}$ OR $\exp(-i \times s \times \theta)$. For spin of an electron, this becomes, $\exp(\frac{-i \theta}{2})$ which has a period of $\theta = 4 \pi$, since only then, the expression will become $\exp(-2 \pi \times i)=1$, that’s why a $720°$ turn is different from a $360°$ turn!)

## Quantization of Spin

So, on discussing the SG Experiment, we concluded that an electron can collapse in only one of two discrete states after a measurement, but why is there this discreteness. The real answer to this question lies in the mathematics of the quantum scale.

As noted in the first article, momentum on the quantum scale is represented by $p = \frac{h}{\lambda}$ where $h$ is a constant (known as the Planck's constant, equal to $6.62607004×10^{-34} \text{m}^2 \text{kg}/\text{s}$. A consequence of this is that the intrinsic angular momentum comes in multiples of what is known as reduced Planck's constant, $\hbar$ , which is just equal to $\frac{h}{2\pi}$, or we say, that the spin is quantized in terms of the reduced Planck's constant.

Why is this, in terms of physical significance? Well, there is no answer to this question; but as a matter of fact, how I like to view this is because quantum states, they are complex numbers, but complex numbers (with a non-negative imaginary part) are not what we can ‘see’ in nature. They can be used to describe nature, but not see nature. For example, you can feed a dozen bananas or $10$ bananas or $308$ bananas to a group of monkeys, but you can never feed that $113+8i$ bananas, right? So, when we have to measure these vectors, we can only see a real number, which is what is called an eigenvalue of the ‘eigenvector’ in the world of quantum mechanics and linear algebra! That’s why the quantum state in the complex plane has to collapse to a point on the real number line during measurement! (*NOTE: The terms vectors and complex numbers are used very interchangeably in this text*)

So, we can conclude after this article on the properties of a quantum property called spin. Though spin is a concept not fully understood by physicists even today, yet this article provides some background information to the reader to answer some ‘WHY’s and ‘HOW’s of spin. We suggest that after reading this article, you should digest upon the fact of the existence of spin, unless a new groudbreaking research establishes a new insight into the world of quantum spin and provides us with content for a follow-up article (smiley)! At the end of the article, we also touch upon the concept of measurement, and its importances. We’ll explore this topic *much, much* more deeply in the next article, which would be out next week, only on Quantum Untangled!
