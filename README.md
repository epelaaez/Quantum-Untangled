# Quantum Untangled
This project aims to make quantum computing accessible to people of all ages. We want to bring the basics of quantum mechanics and quantum computing to a wider public. We intend to do this through a website that will work as a hub for all-things quantum, from articles to interviews and open-source projects.

This repository contains the code for the Quantum Untangled website. Status: under development, blog currently hosted at [Quantum Untangled](https://medium.com/quantum-untangled).

## About us
We are students of The Coding School’s Qubit by Qubit: Introduction to Quantum Computing course. We decided to start this project to promote the field of quantum, since we noticed that it is hard to get into it due to the math and physics requirements to understand most concepts.
