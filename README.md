# Quantum Untangled
This project aims to make quantum computing accessible to people of all ages. We want to bring the basics of quantum mechanics and quantum computing to a wider public. We intend to do this through a website that will work as a hub for all-things quantum, from articles to interviews and open-source projects.

This repository contains the code for the Quantum Untangled website. Status: under development, blog currently hosted at [Quantum Untangled](https://medium.com/quantum-untangled).

## About us
We are students of The Coding School’s Qubit by Qubit: Introduction to Quantum Computing course. We decided to start this project to promote the field of quantum, since we noticed that it is hard to get into it due to the math and physics requirements to understand most concepts.

## Technologies
The following technologies are being used to develop this website and should be installed prior to working on it:
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
- [React](https://reactjs.org)

Once you have these installed, run `npm start` to run the website on you rlocal machine. 

## GitHub pages
While the development of a full stack website is underway, a static website powered by GitHub pages will be available. The code for this website is also available in this repo under the `gh-pages` branch. In order to work on this branch on your local machine, run the following commands after you have cloned the repo from the `main` branch.

```
git switch gh-pages
```

Now, you can use the command `git checkout [branch-name]` to switch between the `main` and the `gh-pages` branches and work on both. For further instructions on collaborating to the website hosted in GitHub Pages read this [file](https://github.com/epelaaez/Quantum-Untangled/blob/gh-pages/README.md).
