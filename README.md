# Quantum Untangled
This project aims to make quantum computing accessible to people of all ages. We want to bring the basics of quantum mechanics and quantum computing to a wider public. We intend to do this through a website that will work as a hub for all-things quantum, from articles to interviews and open-source projects.

This repository contains the code for the Quantum Untangled website, which is accesible [here](https://medium.com/quantum-untangled).

## About us
We met as students of The Coding School’s Qubit by Qubit: Introduction to Quantum Computing course. We decided to start this project to promote the field of quantum, since we noticed that it is hard to get into it due to the math and physics requirements to understand most concepts.

## Technologies
The following technologies are being used to develop this website and should be installed prior to working on it:
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
- [React](https://reactjs.org)

Once you have these installed and have cloned the repository, run `npm start` to run the website on you rlocal machine. 

## GitHub pages
The production build of the website is available in the `gh-pages` branch of this repository. To build and deploy the website into this branch, you need to run the following command. 

```
npm run deploy
```

This script is defined in the `package.json` file and will take care of the rest.
